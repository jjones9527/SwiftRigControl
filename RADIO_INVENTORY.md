## What We Discovered

This inventory revealed that SwiftRigControl has **significantly more radios implemented** than previously documented:

### Previous Understanding (Before Audit)
- Icom: 6 transceivers
- Yaesu: 10 models
- Kenwood: 12 models
- Elecraft: 6 models
- **Total: 34 models**

### Actual Implementation (After Audit)
- Icom: **31 models** (including entire IC-706, IC-746, IC-756 series!)
- Yaesu: 10 models
- Kenwood: 12 models
- Elecraft: 6 models
